        "title": "About Me",
        "detail": "My journey into tech began in 2018, driven by a passion for solving complex problems. I pursued dual degrees in Electrical and Computer Engineering at Addis Ababa University and Computer Science at CPU College, laying a strong foundation in engineering and software development. Immersing myself in competitive programming, I found my stride tackling data structures, algorithms, and building innovative solutions. \n\n Joining Africa to Silicon Valley (A2SV), a Google-backed program transforming African tech talent, marked a pivotal moment in my growth. I advanced from a student to mentor, then Head of Education, and now serve as the Deputy Head of Academy. Leading over 250 students across three universities, I strive to elevate tech education, unlocking opportunities for aspiring engineers.  \n\n I find immense satisfaction in building impactful projects, from contributing to RateEat to developing a machine learning system for mosquito species detection. While JavaScript is my go-to tool for full-stack applications, I’m also adept with GOlang, Python, and dabble in Dart when needed. Technology is my avenue for innovation, problem-solving, and creating meaningful change. Let’s connect and turn ideas into reality. "
