        "Bruk M is an outstanding colleague and a natural-born leader. We first met during A2SV's Cohort 3—he was in Group 32, and I was in Group 31. My initial impression of Bruk was during our Saturday morning social activities, watching him jump sky high during volleyball games. His energy and enthusiasm were contagious even then. When we both became Heads of Education for Cohort 4, after excelling in our own education program, I truly got to see Bruk's incredible capabilities. He's humble, hardworking, energetic, and exceptionally kind. Working alongside him was a pleasure, and his leadership skills were evident in every project we tackled. Now serving as the Deputy Head of Academy, Bruk is leading the G5 education program across three schools. He's responsible for over 260 students and manages a team of more than 25 Heads of Education and instructors. Under his guidance, this has become our most successful cohort to date. He's always striving to improve processes and never settles for less than excellence. Bruk's commitment to enhancing our programs and his relentless pursuit of improvement make him stand out. He's not just a colleague but an inspiration to everyone around him. I have no doubt that he will continue to achieve great things and reach new heights in his career. I wholeheartedly recommend Bruk for any opportunity that comes his way. He's a true asset to any team, and I'm excited to see all that he will accomplish in the future.",
